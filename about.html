          <p> Hello! My name is Kevin Dai and I am a future software engineer. Ever since I was a little kid, I always wondered about the code behind the 
            technologies we use in our daily lives. I wondered how websites were made, how they're interactive with the user, and how to style
            them to be visually appealing. I wondered how games were made, how a character moves, and how a player interacts with the game. 
            My unending curiosity led me to pursue a career in computer science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I am a sophomore computer science major in the Engineering Honors Program at Texas A&M University.
            Over the several years I have been coding, I have completed some interesting projects to not only showcase my abilities and knowledge,
            but also for self enjoyment in the life of coding. Some projects include a complete Anagrams game, a website that visualizes the various 
            sorting algorithms in computer science, and an Amazon E-commerce website. More information about
            these projects can be found on my portfolio page. 
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, I have completed one internship at YouHill Inc. where I helped build a Bluetooth garage door opener. During this
            internship I learned many skills from programming and hardware design to communication in a work place and time management. These
            skills that I learned are invaluable and will be critical to my success as a future software engineer. I am fortunate enough
            to be an incoming software engineering intern at Capital One for the summer of 2023. I look forward to enhancing my already learned
          skills and learning new ones at Capital One.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a inquisitive student, I am interesting in all things technology. I always try to learn the latest technologies and trends in the
            software engineering field. 
            I am interesting in Full Stack Development, Game Development, and Machine Learning.
